2. Our software will have various models for different uses.
  1. model for receptionist to schedule appointment by taking the hospital id.
  2. model for doctor where he/she can see the patient's previous medical records and will give prescription.
  3. model for pharmacist where he/she will get the medicine reciept from doctor so that he/she can provide the medicine to the patient.
